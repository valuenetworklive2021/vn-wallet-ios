Work-in-progress.

How to create a PR
---
Keep commits atomic

1 commit or very few in each PR. Each PR should be doing only 1 thing

Don't introduce unnecessary, unintentional changes, especially adding/removing of whitespace unless it's really part of the PR

Write a clear 1-sentence commit message explaining what the commit is for. If there are important details such as the rationale for doing things in a certain way, add additional lines. `git log --pretty=oneline` should make sense

Draw attention to anything that the reviewer should look out for

If it's a simple UI change, include screenshots like this https://github.com/AlphaWallet/alpha-wallet-ios/pull/3399

If the PR closes an issue, use [GitHub keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (eg. Closes #123) so GitHub will automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.

Commits introduced by PR should be based on the current `master`. Sometimes reviewers will request author to rebase master (`git rebase master`) if `master` has moved significantly since

If the PR is still a work-in-progress, make it a draft (GitHub feature), or use the "WIP. Don't Merge" label

If changes are needed after review, commit changes, rebase into a single (or a few) commits and force push

Code Style
---
CamelCase, including abbreviations (some older code might not observe this)

Leave empty lines empty, without whitespace/indentation

Group private let/var before others in a type

How to Add a New Chain
---
1. Open RPCServers.swift
2. Add a new case to the enum
3. Build and fix the errors. Do not use `switch-default:`
